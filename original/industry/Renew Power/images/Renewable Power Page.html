<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Vesconite Hilube for Renewable Power
bearing applications {PIC Hilube Bush on RHS}<BR><BR></B>Ongoing
climate change makes renewable power sources important in power
generation.<BR>New technologies and developments demand engineering
materials that are equal to the increased demands placed on
them.<BR><BR><B>What are Vesconite and Vesconite Hilube<BR></B>Vesconite
and Vesconite Hilube are advanced bearings materials designed for
long life with minimal maintenance.<BR><BR>Vesconite is self
lubricating and so the need for additional lubrication systems can
often be eliminated.<BR><BR>Vesconite Hilube is a higher grade of
Vesconite with additional solid lubricants for a lower friction and a
longer life.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Vesconite makes ideal bearings for
&quot;green power&quot; applications.<BR><BR>No grease<BR></B>Traditional
grease lubrication of bushings causes contamination of water and
damage to the environment. Vesconite is self lubricating and in many
applications does not require grease, oil or other additional
lubrication.<BR><BR>Vesconite can be lubricated by a wide variety of
available fluids &ndash; water, sea water, etc<BR><BR><B>Environmentally
friendly<BR></B>Vesconite does not contain any harmful components.
Vesconite is suitable for drinking water. Vesconite does not
contaminate the environment.<BR><BR><B>No swell in water<BR></B>Many
new power sources (hydro, tidal and wave power) are water based.
Vesconite does not swell in water and so bushings and bearings can be
designed to close tolerances without the fear of seizure.<BR><BR><B>Longest
life and lowest maintenance</B><BR>Renewable power source equipment
is often in remote locations or difficult to access. Vesconite has a
long life even in poorly maintained applications. Service intervals
are longer and maintenance costs are less.<BR><BR><B>High load
capacity<BR></B>Vesconite carries a high bearing load. The load
capacity of Vesconite is unaffected by water.<BR><BR><B>Applications
for Vesconite<BR></B>Vesconite and Vesconite Hilube may be the
bearing material of choice for no maintenance, long life and
environmentally friendly bearings and bushings.<BR><BR><B>Hydro
Power<BR></B>Vesconite Hilube has been used for Turbine bearings,
wicket gate bushings, trash rake bearings, control linkage bushings,
segmented shaft weals, sluice gate bearings, thrust bearings and
slides, pump bearings and wear rings ... and many more.<BR><BR><B>Wind
Power<BR></B>Vesconite Hilube used widely in pitch adjustment
bushings and slew rings.<BR><BR><B>Wave Power<BR></B>Various wave
power designs require bushings and bearings with high load capacities
and close clearances.<BR><BR><B>Tidal Power<BR></B>Tidal power
systems often use water lubricated bearings that must give a long
life with no maintenance.<BR><BR><B>Alternative bearings
materials<BR></B>Vesconite Hilube offers significant technical
advantages over other bearing materials<BR><BR><B>Elastomers<BR></B>Elastomer
generally have a low bearing capacity and swell in water. Elastomer
bearings must be designed with large clearances to avoid
seizure.<BR>Elastomer bearings give a higher wear rate than Vesconite
Hilube especially in slightly dirty or silted water.<BR><BR><B>Laminated
materials {PIC   Laminated Bush}<BR></B>Laminated materials
delaminate and swell in water.<BR>Laminated bushings are noisy and
this can scare marine life and have a high wear rate.<BR>Vesconite is
homogeneous and does not delaminate or swell in water. The low
friction of Vesconite Hilube eliminates stick-slip and bearings
operate quietly.<BR><BR><B>Bronze   {PIC Bronze}<BR></B>Bronze must
be greased regularly to avoid high wear rates. Grease contaminates
water supplies and affects marine life.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Vesconite Hilube is self lubricating
and so greasing can often be eliminated.<BR><BR><B>Rubber   {PIC
Rubber}<BR></B>Wears quickly in poorly lubricated conditions.<BR>Rubber
bearings exhibit stick slip which scares marine life and causes shaft
vibration.<BR><BR><B>Applications in Hydro Power    {PIC Hoover
Dam}<BR></B>Bearings used in Hydro Power plants and supporting
equipment are required to have long life with little or no
maintenance.<BR><BR>Vesconite Hilube is ideal for critical
applications in Hydro Power plants.</P>
