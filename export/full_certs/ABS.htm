<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><font face="Arial"><b>Intended Service</b>:<br>
Water lubricated propeller shaft bearings. Strut on after stern tube and forward 
stern tube rudder stock bearings dry or water lubricated. Bushes fitted in 
housing, in or out of water.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><font face="Arial"><b>Description</b>:<br>
Standard and Hilube unclad or with an outer polyester / epoxy composite cladding 
(Vesconite &quot;Superclad&quot;). Thermoplastic Polyester Polymer based busing for 
propeller shafts, rudder stock and pintle bearings. The outer diameter may be 
built up with Vesconite Superclad composite polyester reinforced epoxy resin to 
the required final outer diameter in a minimum composite thickness of 2 mm for 
bushings 100 mm outside diameter and upwards. The thickness of the Vesconite 
bush propeller will be in excess of 15 mm for grooved propeller shaft bearing 
and 10 mm for ungrooved rudder bearings.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><font face="Arial"><b>Ratings</b>:<br>
Bearing surface pressures for rudder bearings up to 5.5 N/mm2 with the length / 
diameter ratio of the bearing surface not to be greater than 1.2. See note 4, 
below. The length of the bearing next to and supporting the propeller is not to 
be less than four times the required tail shaft diameter. Size range, physical 
and mechanical properties, friction and wear as per manufacturer's data.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><font face="Arial"><b>Service Restrictions</b>:<br>
Basic design criteria for rudder bearings are maximum bearing pressure P not to 
exceed 5.5 N/mm squared, the length of bearing not to be greater than 1.2 times 
the required rudder stock diameter, and for the propeller support bearings, the 
length of bearing not to be less than 4.0 times the required tail shaft 
diameter. See also note a.) below. In addition, the environment is expected to 
be generally dry in a housing or in contact with water/sea water, at 
temperatures not exceeding 60 degrees C.</font></p>

<b>Comments</b>:<br>
a) Type approval of this type of bearing for propeller shafts and rudder stock 
bearings is based on compliance, in all respects, with ABS Rules in association 
with the intended service and is limited to the rating as indicated above; b) 
The bearing (sleeve bush bearing) is to be designed so as to ensure adequate 
water circulation and thus promote hydrodynamic lubrication; c) The running 
clearance, swelling of the material, wall thickness, machining allowance, 
interference fit of the bushing into a housing, installation procedure including 
locking of the bushes in the position within the housing are to be in accordance 
with manufacturer's recommendations; d) Higher values of the maximum allowable 
surface pressure for rudder bearing application than given in Table 3/5.2 of the 
Rules may be taken upon special application.</font></p>
